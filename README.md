# Automated-fuzzing-script
INTRODUCTION

This Python script automates the process of fuzzing using the ffuf tool, a versatile and fast web fuzzer. Fuzzing is a testing technique that involves sending a large number of input variations to an application to discover vulnerabilities, potential security issues, or unexpected behavior.

The script simplifies the process by providing a convenient way to run ffuf with your specified target URL, wordlist, and output directory. If ffuf is not already installed on your system, the script can automatically download and install it.
Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

    Python 3.x installed on your system.

    The requests library. You can install it using pip:

    bash

    pip install requests

Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the script:
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command, replacing REPO_URL with the URL of your repository:

bash

git clone REPO_URL
cd your-repo-name

2. Make the Script Executable

Ensure that the script is executable. If it's not marked as executable, use the chmod command:

bash

chmod +x fuzzing_script.py

3. Install Dependencies

If you haven't installed the requests library, do so by running:

bash

pip install requests

You're now ready to use the script.
Usage

To run the fuzzing script, use the following command:

bash

python fuzzing_script.py

The script will prompt you for the following information:

    Target URL: Enter the URL you want to fuzz. Use the placeholder FUZZ in the URL to indicate where ffuf should inject payloads.

    Wordlist Path: Provide the path to your wordlist file containing the payloads to fuzz with.

    Output Directory: Specify the directory where the ffuf output files will be saved.

The script will then execute ffuf with the provided parameters, automating the fuzzing process. The results will be saved in the output directory you specified.
Script Explanation
Automating the Fuzzing Process

The primary goal of this script is to automate the fuzzing process using ffuf with minimal user interaction. It guides you through the process by asking for the necessary input and then runs ffuf with your provided parameters.
Downloading and Installing ffuf

If ffuf is not detected on your system, the script can automatically download and install it from the official GitHub releases. This ensures that ffuf is available for the fuzzing process. The installation process includes the following steps:

    Determining the operating system and architecture to select the appropriate ffuf release.

    Creating a temporary directory for the download.

    Downloading the ffuf ZIP archive from the GitHub releases.

    Extracting the ffuf executable from the archive.

    Moving the ffuf executable to a location in your system's PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin on Linux or ~/.local/bin for local user installation).

    Making the ffuf executable by adjusting its permissions.

Customization

The script provides a basic level of customization by allowing you to specify the target URL, wordlist, and output directory. You can also adjust the number of threads in the ffuf command based on your system's capabilities.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific needs or to add further features or automation steps. For example, you could add error handling, logging, or additional configuration options.
